### NB! This repository is no longer being updated. The up-to-date version is found [here](https://github.com/catalyticmaterials/CHEAT)

CHEAT is a set of Python modules for regression of adsorption energies and modeling catalysis on high-entropy alloys.
This modeling procedure is described in detail here:

## CHEAT modules
All modules contain further explanation and instructions within each subdirectory. Data have been provides so that each module contains a working example.

The [data](data) module assists setting up DFT calculations. Optimized geometries are stored in ASE databases and can subsequently be joined into a single database to construct regression features.

The [features](features) modules will reduce optimized geometries to features suitable for regression of adsorption energies. Currently two types of feature schemes are available: a zone-reduced schemed based on equivalent atomic positions relative to the adsorption site and a graph-based feature scheme.

The [regression](regression) modules trains the corrensponding regression model, Piecewise Linear regression (PWL) or Graph Convolutional Neural Network (GCN), depending on the chosen feature scheme and benchmarks adsorption energy prediction accuracy.

The [surface](surface) module simulates a high-entropy alloy surface of a given size, predicts the available adsorption energies and simulates adsorbate coverage including competitive co-adsorption of \*O and \*OH. Based on established theory a catalytic activity can be estimated.

The [search](search) module apply the above step in a Bayesian optimization procedure to maximize the catalytic activity within the given composition space.
